#HTML5 Unshredder
----

Try it out here: http://reedrosenbluth.com/projects/UnshredderJS/

This is my HTML5 unshredder, inspired by [instagram's unshredder challenge](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder). Simply drag a shredded image (like the ones I have provided in the samples images folder) into the browser and click "Unshred!!!".

*Currently only works in Firefox and Chrome
