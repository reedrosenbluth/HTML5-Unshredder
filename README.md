#HTML5 Unshredder
----

This is my HTML5 unshredder, inspired by [instagram's unshredder challenge](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder). Simply drag a shredded image (like sample.png that is provided in the repository) into the browser and click "Unshred!!!".
