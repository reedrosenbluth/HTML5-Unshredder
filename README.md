# HTML5 Unshredder

This is my HTML5 unshredder, inspired by [instagram's unshredder challenge](http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder). Simply drag a shredded image (like the ones I have provided in the samples images folder) into the browser and click "Unshred!!!".
